# Random Sentence Generator

A simple project that group some semi random words to create a sentence.

## How does it work?

The project is divided in 4 parts. I used portuguese because is the language that I'm more confortable with.

1. Select article.
2. Check if is masculin, feminin, singular or plural article and then select and update the noun based on that.
3. Select a verb and a sentence finalization.
4. Join in a complete sentence.
